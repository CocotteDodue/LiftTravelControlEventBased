# LiftTravelControl
.NETCore C# desktop application that simulate a lift travel control management system.

This is a technical task that is design to assess the programming skills (design, architecture, code, approach) of the candidate.
The task specification is as follow:

>You are in charge of writing software for an elevator (lift) company.
>Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a the lift for a 10 storey building.
>
>A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor, once in the lift they can choose the floor theyâ€™d like to travel to.
>Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop,  and open its doors.

In order to help with the development process, a set of scenarii has been provided:
1. Passenger summons lift on the ground floor. Once in chooses to go to level 5.
2. Passenger summons lift on level 6 to go down. Passenger on level 4 summons the lift to go down. They both choose L1.
3. Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from L2. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 1 chooses to go to L6. Passenger 2 chooses to go to Ground Floor
4. Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from Ground. They choose L5. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 3 summons lift to go down from L10. Passengers 2 and 3 choose to travel to Ground._
