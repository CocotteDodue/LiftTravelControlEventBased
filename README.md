# LiftTravelControl Event based
.NETCore C# desktop application that simulate a lift travel control management system.

This is a technical task that is design to assess the programming skills (design, architecture, code, approach) of the candidate.
The task specification is as follow:

>You are in charge of writing software for an elevator (lift) company.
>Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a the lift for a 10 storey building: 
> * 1: Ground floor
> * 10: 10th floor
>
>A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor, once in the lift they can choose the floor theyâ€™d like to travel to.
>Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop,  and open its doors.

In order to help with the development process, a set of scenarii has been provided:
1. Passenger summons lift on the ground floor. Once in chooses to go to level 5.
2. Passenger summons lift on level 6 to go down. Passenger on level 4 summons the lift to go down. They both choose L1.
3. Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from L2. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 1 chooses to go to L6. Passenger 2 chooses to go to Ground Floor
4. Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from Ground. They choose L5. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 3 summons lift to go down from L10. Passengers 2 and 3 choose to travel to Ground._


### What is used in this project?
* Simple .NETCore console app & xunit Test project
* Development process: Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Event-base system to simulate lift real behavior and interaction with its environment
    * concurent input-output on console: update lift information (current position, parked/traveling, direction of travel, state of doors)
    * accept new request for floor destination at anytime
    * accept summon request at anytime
    * on the fly reorganize its traveling plan to account for new requests
    * take into consideration sensors inputs: do not travel with door open / open door on arrival / close door after opening
    * notify on :
      * floor number reached
      * arrived / departed
      * door movment
* Run: 
  * Take into consideration common sense to initialize the program
  * close on escape
